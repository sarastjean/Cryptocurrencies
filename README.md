## What is Cryptocurrency and how does it work?

Cryptocurrencies use decentralized technology to let users make secure payments and store money without the need to use their name or go through a bank. They run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, which is a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders.

This shows that many difference coins available still have potential to be mined which looks promising to future investors in this newer form of money investment.
